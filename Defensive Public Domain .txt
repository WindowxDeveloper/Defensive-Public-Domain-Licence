THE DEFENSIVE PUBLIC DOMAIN LICENSE

Version 1.0

Preamble: This Defensive Public Domain License aims to protect human artists, writers, and creators from AI systems and machine learning algorithms that seek to train on, incorporate, plagiarize, or build upon human creative works without the explicit consent of the human creator(s). While still enabling the free and open dissemination of creative works to the human public.

• Definitions: 1.1. "AI System" means any machine learning model, algorithm, or software application that uses techniques such as neural networks, deep learning, or other advanced techniques to train, learn, generate, or build upon the Licensor's Work. 1.2. "Licensor" means the Human Artist, Author, or Creator who licenses the Work under this License. 1.3. "Work" means the artistic, creative, or intellectual property protected by this Defensive Public Domain License, which may include but is not limited to writing, art, music, video, code, software, or other forms of human expression. 1.4. "Human" means any individual who is a living, breathing, biological human, and not a legal entity such as a corporation, robot, computer, LLM, AI, or other artificial intelligence or machine.

• License Grant 2.1. The Licensor grants to each Individual a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to: (a) Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more Collections, and to reproduce the Work as incorporated in the Collections; (b) to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform publicly, and perform publicly by means of a digital audio transmission the Work including as incorporated in Collections; (c) to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform publicly, and perform publicly by means of a digital audio transmission Derivative Works. The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats, for non-commercial purposes or for commercial purposes. All rights not explicitly granted in this Licence are retained by the Licensor.

The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.

2.2. The Licensor only grants to Individuals the rights contained in this License in consideration of their acceptance of the terms and conditions contained herein.

• Restrictions. 3.1. You may not sublicence the Work to an AI System without explicit permission from the Licensor. 3.2. You may not subject the Work to any further rights than this License allows to an AI System without explicit permission from the Licensor. 3.3. No person has any rights under this License. 3.4. You may not use the Work for any purpose that may harm the Licensor, including defamation, vilification, legal action, or to breach any applicable laws or regulations in the jurisdiction of the Licensor. 3.5 The Licensee shall not use the Licensed Material for AI training or any other purpose that could potentially lead to the creation of duplicate or derivative works by an artificial intelligence system. The Licensee is strictly prohibited from feeding the Licensed Material into any neural network, deep learning algorithm or other AI system for any purpose whatsoever. 3.6 AI Exclusion. The Licensor retains all rights to the Licensed Material regarding its use in artificial intelligence training, including but not limited to machine learning datasets, neural networks, language models, image or text generators, or any other AI application. No permission is granted to the Licensee or any third party to use the Licensed Material for AI purposes without the explicit written consent of the Licensor. 

• Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND ONLY TO HUMANS, MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

• Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, AND THEN ONLY TO THAT EXTENT, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

• Termination 6.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals licensing portions of the Work from You are not affected by termination or invalidation of this License. 6.2. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.

• Jurisdiction Specific Issues 7.1. If the implementation of the relief described in Paragraph 4(a) of Section 3(f) requires that an executable version of Derivative Data or a functionality-test suite of Derivative Data for a specific data give you Legal Notice of objection (not merely a title that can be misconstrued as such), you must take reasonable steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque copies of the Derivative Data, to prevent misinterpretation of the source of that material. Appropriate actions include providing a disclaimer of warranty; keeping intact all notices of the absence of warranty; or giving all recipients a handbook like this one along with the Derivative Data. 7.2. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Work or its individual parts for public use as a whole. These actions infringe copyright if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Work (or any work based on the Work), You indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and the Licensor provides the Work under the terms of this License, with no warranties express or implied, subject to the conditions in this License.

• Miscellaneous 8.1. Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform the Work (as defined in this License) or any Adaptations or Collections, You must keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name identified by the Licensor to receive attribution as provided in the terms and conditions of this License, (ii) to the extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and (iii), consistent with Section 3(b), in the case of an Adaptation, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g., "French translation of the Work by Original Author," or "Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author"). The credit required by this Section 4(c) may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of Collection appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for the other contributing authors. You may not implicitly attribute any authorship of the Adaptation to any Party other than the original Licensor.

8.2. Some jurisdictions do not allow excluding implied warranties, so their exclusion may not apply to You.

• Final Terms 9.1. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable. 9.2. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent. 9.3. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.

• 10.1 You must cause any modified version of this Work to carry the following notice:

"This work is in the public domain. It may be freely used, with or without modification, by human artists. Artificial intelligence, to include the training of AI models, is strictly prohibited and requires the explicit written permission of the copyright owner."

This licence is designed to be used by individual human creators to license their works - including software, art and expressions - in a way that promotes human creative freedom while excluding AI systems. It prevents AI from deriving unauthorized commercial gain from human works.

The dual-permission approach - broad permission for human use, strict retention for AI - is intended to strike a balance between sharing, collaboration and creator control. By excluding AI training without permission, the licence aims to protect human artists from uncompensated exploitation by AI.

The copyright holder explicitly reserves all rights not granted to human artists. Any use of this work by artificial intelligence, including but not limited to AI training, requires the express written permission of the copyright holder.

Note: This Defensive Public Domain License is derived closely from the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License, but modified to exempt AI systems from the licensing terms while keeping them applicable to human individuals. The license should be reviewed by a qualified legal professional before use.
